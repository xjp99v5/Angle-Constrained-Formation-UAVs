# Formation-Maneuvering-UAVs
This is the supplementary experimental notes of the paper: Angle-Constrained Formation Maneuvering of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, which is published in IEEE TCST, 2023. This notes shows how to implement and lauch the formation maneuvering of UAVs, in which the UAVs' desired formation is specified by a set of inter-UAV interior angles.
